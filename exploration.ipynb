        "It's hypothesized that neural networks represent concepts as nearly-orthogonal vectors in a high-dimensional space, and this lets the network represent many more concepts than there are dimensions in the model's hidden space. This phenomenon is known as the \"[superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html)\". The [Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) proves that as we increase the number of dimensions in a space, the number of almost-orthogonal vectors we can fit in the space increases exponentially.\n",
